# The Pykemon

This extremely basic _(mostly hardcoded)_ game was built as a portfolio project for my High School Student Council application in August 2021.   

**The Pykemon** is a text-based RPG game written entirely in Python where users can fight Pokemon monsters through easy-to-understand controls and attack patterns.   
This game was built primitively with only conditionals, loops, basic RNG, and a simple saving mechanism, due to my 0 formal education background in Python at the time.

(very cringe, but pls remember I was 16 years old and it was mid-COVID lockdown in 2021 :D)
